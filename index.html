<h4>Words just don't flow for everyone all the time. Sometimes they get stuck, or they're so outdone by other creative skills that it's hard to nurture them out anymore. But we all need them, and they lubricate creative transactions. Without a good set of words, it's often hard to communicate your vibe to the people you need to reach at the most important moments.</h4>

<p>'Maneki neko' means lucky cat, or fortune cat in Japanese. Shop owners place a statue of a cat at the door of their shop to encourage good fortune for their business. I feel like writing does the same thing, even if it's in a somewhat more direct manner. So, consider me your maneki neko - I want to help you do your thing and bring you good fortune.</p>

<p>I don't personally believe that creative consultancy and creative commerical copywriting and strategy is a job that has specialised training. The reason why I'm doing it is because I can't stop it from happening to me. Let me explain...</p>

<p>I graduated high school with a token award as 'Most Creative' and a burning desire to learn. I worked hard on a vague dream of writing short fiction, which was successful for a time. After I popped out of university, I found myself bouncing between various jobs in the creative arts field, from commercial photographer to music teacher, performing musician to journalist. I eventually found my way into editing other people's words, and shortly thereafter... web development. Long story. I met a lot of people along the way.</p>

<p>I also experienced what it's like to work in small businesses of varying sizes and specialities and saw how important communication was for the internal and external successes of those enterprises.</p>

<blockquote>For a long time I felt that 'creative writing' meant fiction and poetry, whimsy and fantasy. I never believed that 'creative' work could also be commercial or 'useful', but things have changed. I realised that I didn't want to write things that had no reason to be - I realised that I wanted to creatively solve problems and help people.</blockquote>
